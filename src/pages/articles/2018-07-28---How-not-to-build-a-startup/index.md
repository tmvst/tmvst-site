### This is a story of how I&nbsp;built FeedBear ‚Äì my first real project I&nbsp;take seriously and ask money for. I&nbsp;can't say that its start was unusual, but I&nbsp;would 100% advise to not repeat my mistakes.

It has become a standard for founders to write about their journey of how they built a product. How they got that first customer. Maybe sprinkle some missteps here and there to keep it real and interesting.

This story is different. I did many crucial things wrong. I would even say that I did _most_ of the things wrong. Yet despite that, **I still managed to build something useful** and get that first, happy, paying customer. That was the one thing I did good.

## Knowledge is important, but it's not everything

The name of my college's masters program I studied was "Service science". That included marketing, sales, business, finance, everything. I've read many books about startups, endless medium artcles, blog posts, success stories, failure stories, you name it. All this indicates I should be as ready to build something useful _the proper way_ as I can possibly be.

But that doesn't mean I followed that advice.

Having all of that knowledge in my head ‚Äì when it came to action ‚Äì didn't seem to matter. I guess I need to experience things myself and come up with my own recipe to success. To learn from my own mistakes was always the way for me.

Now, there's two angles to see this from. The first is _"Look! You can succeed even if you don't know what you're doing!"_. And the second is the _"Please don't repeat my mistakes"_ one. I'm going with the second one. There's a lot more to learn there.

## The not so lean startup üêñ

Everybody knows what is the lean way to build businesses. What is an MVP and how you should have customers waiting with the money at your door before you even write the first line of code.

So I built a quick landing page, sent it to some people and got a positive response. There was no selling involved, no price tag attached. The responses were somewhere along the lines of _"Yes, I totally need this."_, or _"I needed this so bad I built it myself!"_.

You can imagine how this was completely enough for me to start building FeedBear. My plan was to create the most basic version and get some beta users to grow it further. That sounds like a good plan, but my definition of _"the most basic version"_ started to shift as I worked.
