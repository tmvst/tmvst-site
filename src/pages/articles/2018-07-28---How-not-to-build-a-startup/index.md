Disclaimer: This is an article about mistakes, haste and poor judgment. Under any circumstances, please avoid doing what you read here.

It has become a standard for founders to write about their journey of how they built a product. How they got that first customer. Maybe sprinkle some missteps here and there to keep it real and interesting. My story is different. I did many crucial things wrong. I would even say that I did **most** of the things wrong. Yet despite that, I still managed to build something useful and get that first, happy, paying customer. That was the one thing I did good.

First, some background. The name of my college's masters program I studied was "Service science". That included marketing, sales, business, finance, everything. I've read many books about startups, endless medium artcles, blog posts, success stories, failure stories, you name it. All this indicates I should be as ready to build something useful the proper way as I can possibly be.

But that doesn't mean I followed that advice.

Having all of that knowledge in my head – when it came to action – didn't seem to matter. I guess I need to experience things myself and come up with my own recipe to success. To learn from my mistakes was always the way for me. Do something and learn from the result afterwards.
